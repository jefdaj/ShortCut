# This tests that lists created in different ways are interchangable,
# which is important for set unions to remove duplicate list elements.

# TODO are there any other ways? maybe these but with other fn calls?
# TODO simple(ish) solution: limit to 1 symlink by following them when linking
#      there are only 3 places they're made; not too bad

list1 = load_faa_each ["data/6803genes10.faa"]
list2 = [load_faa "data/6803genes10.faa"]
result = length (list1 | list2) # should be 1, since they're the same
