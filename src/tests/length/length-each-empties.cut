# A list of empty lists should have a nonzero length. (This was surprisingly
# tricky to get working because it conflicts with deduplicating lists by their
# content)

# TODO include a repl test for the types?

# TODO maybe don't dedup lists themselves, just in set ops?
# TODO there's also a potentially serious bug: type "[[], [1]]", get [[], []]

zero = length_each []
one  = length_each [[]]
two  = length_each [[], []]

result = zero | one | two # should be [0.0]
