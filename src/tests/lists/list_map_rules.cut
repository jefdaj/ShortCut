# Mapping a function over a list should be the same as making a list of
# individual function applications. That's currently not true though, because
# of some problem with the map function.

# hey maybe the issue is just that it gets "load_faa" and decides it found the function?
list1 = load_faa_each ["data/6803genes10.faa"]
list2 = [load_faa "data/6803genes10.faa"]
result = length (list1 | list2) # should be 1, not 2!
