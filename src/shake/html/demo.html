    [at({}, "The summary supplies the overall data about the build. Looking at the build below, we can see there was 1 execution, involving 80 files and 27 command lines. If we ran the build sequentially, we'd expect it to take 42.95s, but parallelism reduced that to 12.28s.")
    ,at({mode:"help"}, "These reports provide a way of filtering, grouping and viewing the result of running a Shake build system. A query is entered at the top using the text box, run using the 'Run' button, and produces a report whose type is selected from the drop-down box. The 'Link' hyperlink provides a link to the currently entered query, which is useful for copying/sharing. The help page provides lots of good example reports.")
    ,at({mode:"cmd-plot"}, "The command plot view shows how many commands were executing at each point throughout the build. We can see the build runs about 6 parallel 'cl' commands to start with, then at the end runs a 'link' commands serially. We could speed up the build if we could make the 'link' phase run in parallel or reduce it's time.")
    ,at({mode:"cmd-plot",query:"name(/(\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)$/, \"???\")"}, "Staying on the command plot view, we can now group by extension of the file being produced, instead of the command being run. We use a regular expression on 'name' in the filter, where the matched expression produces a group (this example is available on the 'Help' tab). We can now see the 'link' phase creates '.lib' files quickly then spends a lot of time producing '.exe' files.")
    ,at({mode:"cmd-table"}, "The command table gives us the data from the plot in tabular form. We can see there are 25 'cl' commands and 2 'link' commands. While this table shows the 'cl' calls taking 86% of the time, we know from the plot that these calls are mostly parallelised.")
    ,at({mode:"cmd-table",query:"group(command() + \" - \" + name())"}, "Since there are only 27 commands in total we can view all commands separately by grouping on the command plus the name of the file (which is probably unique). We can see the slowest action is the 'link' phase producing 'ninja.exe' in 5.26s.")
    ,at({mode:"rule-table"}, "The rule table shows which rules have been run. The table is initially sorted by 'time' and we can see 'ninja.exe' is the slowest rule (which we already knew). The 'run' column says how many runs ago the rule ran, so 0 means it ran in the last execution.")
    ,at({mode:"rule-table",sort:"cost"}, "We can sort by 'cost' which predicts the single-threaded time to rebuild if the file changed. We can see 'win32port.h' took 0s to build (it's a source file), but if it changes 90% of the files will rebuild, taking 39s. We should either make sure that header changes rarely, or try to include it in fewer places.")
    ,at({mode:"rule-table",query:"ancestorOf(\"version.obj\") && leaf()"}, "Using the rule table we can restrict which rows are displayed. Here we are looking for files that go into 'version.obj' and are source files (the 'leaf' restriction). The include files in 'version' look very reasonable.")
    ,at({mode:"rule-graph",query:"name(/(\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)$/, \"???\")"}, "The rule graph mode draws a dependency graph. While we can draw a dependency graph of the entire project (just use the empty query) the result is large and unwieldy. Instead, we group by file extension, which shows that the '.obj' file depends on '.h', '.c' and '.cc' files - as we would expect.")
    ,at({mode:"rule-graph",query:"group(command())"}, "We can apply grouping to the rule graph, naming each node with its command. We can see that 'cl' commands depend on nodes that require no commands (source files), and thus can be run in parallel. In contrast, 'link' depends on the results of 'cl' and results of itself, effectively serialising the 'link' commands.")
