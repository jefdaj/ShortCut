not sure if it's really fake but whatever
you could have a shortcut type be a simple list of haskell values
but there should be one for "set of whatever", where you write the whatever
that way you can say [SetOf (Some "thing"), SetOf num, (Some "thing")]
the "thing" wouldn't mean anything except it could be used in error messages
the typechecker would just require each "a" to match the same type in the fn call

oooh, but this might get complicated if they also return the (Some "thing")!
maybe don't go down that road. simpler to have each record (function) check itself?
