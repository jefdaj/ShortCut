assigning something shouldn't also run it
	seems that assigning anything causes result to be re-evaluated?
  except assigning result itself, ironically
	if result is :dropped, then you get fromJust: Nothing when assigning to anything
		also happens when running script with no result var
	only happens when assigning to result in repl
	but when assigning *anything* to result, it evals result
	but when assigning at all in a script
	wait, is this just compiling and not running, as it's supposed to?

stdout capture issue with Tasty/Silently
  try to make a reproducable example for SO
  consider switching to Writer monad
  consider redirecting directly to a file

tests/list01
	doesn't create the output file
	not sure if this is an actual problem
	next steps:
		remove explicit empty list case altogether
		put in a sensible error instead

tests/repl03
	that one line keeps printing to actual stdout instead of being captured
	some kind of interaction between tasty and silently?
	next steps:
		try reproducing it without tasty (separate main file)
		email/file github issue with author
		ask on stackoverflow

division
	division by certain numbers hangs for a long time (forever?)
	seems to only happen with non-powers-of-two?
	next steps:
		try manually `read`ing + doing the math in ghci
