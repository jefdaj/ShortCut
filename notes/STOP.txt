STOP! BEFORE CONTINUING TO CODE, READ PAPERS + MAKE A HIGH-LEVEL PLAN!
SPEND SUNDAY ON THAT ONLY! (FOR OTHER PROJECTS TOO, NOT JUST SHORTCUT)
TRY APPROACHING IT THIS WAY:
	MAKE ONE LIST OF THINGS YOU CAN DO/WORK ON FROM YOUR CURRENT POSITION
	MAKE ANOTHER OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE CYANO/PS FIELD
		WHAT CAN WE CURRENTLY DO
		WHAT DO WE CURRENTLY KNOW/WANT TO KNOW
	AND A THIRD OF THE KIND OF THINGS PEOPLE SEEM TO PUBLISH (big/lil? long/short? ...)
	PICK THINGS TO PITCH THAT OVERLAP ALL 3

YOU HAVE 3 WEEKS UNTIL LAB MEETING
MAKE ABOUT THEN THE DEADLINE TO HAVE PROGRESS ON PICKING A THESIS COMMITTEE TOO
	BUT PROGRESS COULD JUST BE GOING TO MEET WITH KRIS ABOUT IT!
		in fact progress definitely should include that
SO BEFORE EITHER OF THOSE, ENTIRELY SWITCH SHORTCUT CODING -> READING + PITCHING
