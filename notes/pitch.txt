ShortCut code aims to be:

* shorter than an english description of the same algorithm
* reproducable on different computers at different times
* trivially updated when new genomes or annotations come out
* robust to changes in the search parameters (if done properly)
* explored interactively or run as a script, depending on expected runtime
* automatically parallelized to any number of cores
* valid when saved at any point in a live interpreter session
