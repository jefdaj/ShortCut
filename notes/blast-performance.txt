all were probably started around 12:15 - 12:30?
finishing times and line counts:
	12:36 21389
	12:58 707151
	12:58 80339
	12:59 1471487
	13:02 3313459
	13:05 1067964
	13:46 134885709
so it definitely makes a difference!

what about the results themselves? filtered to the strictest evalue are they the same?
