You can type or paste OrthoLang code here to run it, same as in a script.
Unlike in a script though, you can also evaluate and redefine variables.
There are also some extra commands specific to --interactive mode:

:help      to print info about a function or filetype
:load      to clear the current session and load a script
:reload    to reload the current script
:write     to save the whole script (or dependencies of a specific variable)
:depends   to show which variables a given variable depends on
:rdepends  to show which variables depend on the given variable ("reverse depends")
:drop      to discard the current script (or a specific variable)
:quit      to discard the current script and exit the interpreter
:type      to print the type of an expression
:show      to print an expression along with its type
:shell     to run the rest of the line as a shell command (disabled in --secure mode)
:!         as a shorter alias for :shell
