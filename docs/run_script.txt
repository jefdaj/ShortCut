This is a special function for using your own scripts in OrthoLang. The first
str argument is name/path of the script to run, and the second is a "list of
whatever". That is, it ignores the type system and lets you pass it any mixture
of values. You'll need to make sure your script expects the type of files you
give it and returns something formatted reasonably.

If you want to use the result in further OrthoLang functions, follow the same
conventions they do. This is easiest if you copy one of the existing scripts to
start from. For example you could copy filter_hits.R and change it to filter
for particular genes rather than an e-value cutoff, and the result would still
work in any other function expecting a hit table.

If not, you can return anything and use it as the overall result. This would be
useful, for example, if you want to gather all previous results and run another
pipeline on them, or make a publication-quality plot in R.
