Like tblastx, but BLASTs against an existing database.

WARNING: this is slow. It's roughly equivalent to 6 * 6 = 36 blastp searches.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query FASTA nucleic acid file
  a subject BLAST nucleotide database

Algorithm:
  BLAST translated query sequences against translated database sequences

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
