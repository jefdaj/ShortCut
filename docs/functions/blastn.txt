BLAST one file of nucleic acid (DNA) sequences against another.

WARNING: when you set the NCBI site to use blastn, it actually does something
closer to the ortholang megablast function. You should use megablast for fast
high-similarity matches or blastn if you want to find shorter, less similar
matches. See this blog post for details:

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query   FASTA nucleic acid file
  a subject FASTA nucleic acid file

Algorithm:
  make a nucleotide database from the subject sequences
  BLAST the query sequences against the database

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
