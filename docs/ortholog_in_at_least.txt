List the orthogroups that have a member in at least some fraction of a list of proteomes.

Gotcha: when given a number >= 1, it converts it to a fraction using the number of proteomes.
When given a negative number it subtracts from the total.
For example if you have 10 proteomes, these all find groups that span at least 6 of them:

TODO is the last one confusing?

ortholog_in_at_least 6      ...
ortholog_in_at_least 0.6    ...
ortholog_in_at_least (-4)   ...
ortholog_in_at_least (-0.4) ...
