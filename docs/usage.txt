A scripting language that makes short work of phylogenomic cuts.

Usage:
  ortholang --help FNORTYPE | --version
  ortholang [options]

Options:
  --help FNORTYPE    Print possibly-helpful info about a function or filetype.
  --version          Print version number and exit.
  --debug REGEX      Log debugging messages matching REGEX.
  --test PATTERN     Run tests matching PATTERN. See github.com/feuerbach/tasty for syntax.
  --interactive      Start the interpreter, and load SCRIPT if any. This is
                     the default if no arguments are given.
  --typecheck        Don't run the script yet, just print any type errors.
  --script SCRIPT    OrthoLang script to run, or load with --interactive
  --tmpdir TMPDIR    Where to cache results, including many large
                     intermediate files.
  --config CONFIG    Load any/all of these options from a config file.
  --workdir WORKDIR  Working directory and start point for relative paths.
  --wrapper WRAPPER  Script to wrap arbitrary system commands. Use this to
                     optimize concurrency and work around other quirks of your
                     system.
  --report HTML      Write an interactive HTML report that helps optimize
                     performance. Not sure whether this works well with SLURM
                     or not yet.
  --secure           Make things a little more secure for webserver use.
                     So far, it just disables shell access through the :! command.
  --noprogress       Do not display the progress bar.
  --shared SHARED    A shared cache (directory or url) to look up files.
  --outfile OUTFILE  Instead of printing results, save them to this file.
