BLAST two FASTA nucleic acid files against each other and keep only the
reciprocal best hits.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  two nucleic acid file FASTA files

Algorithm:
  make a nucleotide database from each FASTA file
  BLAST each FASTA file against the other database
  filter the forward hits table for reciprocal best hits in the reverse one

Output:
  a table of the best forward hit per pair of reciprocal best hits

It's like taking the reciprocal_best of two blastn functions.
For example, these rb_hits are the same:

  fwd_hits = blastn 1e-20 species1 species2
  rev_hits = blastn 1e-20 species2 species1
  rb_hits1 = reciprocal_best fwd_hits rev_hits

  rb_hits2 = blastn_rbh 1e-20 species1 species2

Order matters if you want to inspect the resulting table, but if you only care
about pairs of matching genes genes then fwd and rev are interchangable.
