# Tests the repeat function, which is like replace_each except without any
# explicit permutations. That's trickier than it sounds because we have to
# make a list of permutations with different salts. Otherwise it will just
# return the first evaluation N times, which is useless.

var1 = 2 # will be repeated 5 times with salts 1..5
result = repeat (var1 * 3) var1 5
