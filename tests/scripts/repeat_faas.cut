# Checks for a bug where repeated sampling would always give the same list.
# Also, note that in ShortCut this "random" sampling should be entirely
# deterministic (same tmpfiles + answer each time).

# sample 5 of about 20 genomes randomly
faa_names = glob_files "data/Mycoplasma_*.faa"
use5 = sample 5 faa_names

# repeat the sampling operation 100 times
use5manytimes = repeat use5 faa_names 100

# how many files got picked every time?
# probably 0, but all 5 with the sampling bug :(
result = all use5manytimes
