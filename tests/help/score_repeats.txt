score_repeats : num any any.list -> any.scores
where
  any is the input type
Shorthand for the common use case where you want to score your cut by some
metric, for example number of hits, then vary one of the input parameters and
see how the score changes.

Arguments are the same as for repeat_each, except the output variable must be a
number. It returns a table of scores and the corresponding inputs. You can
inspect them yourself, or plot them in OrthoLang.

Examples:

linegraph
  "How does the cutoff change the number of hits?"
  (score_repeats (length hits) initial_cutoff alternate_cutoffs)
