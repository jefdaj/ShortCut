blastx : num fna faa -> bht

where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  faa = FASTA amino acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

BLAST nucleic acid (DNA) sequences against amino acid (protein) sequences.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query   FASTA nucleic acid file
  a subject FASTA amino acid file

Algorithm:
  make a protein database from the subject protein sequences
  translate the query DNA sequences (all 6 reading frames)
  BLAST the resulting query proteins against the database

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
