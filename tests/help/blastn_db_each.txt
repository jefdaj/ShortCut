num fna fna.blastdb.list -> list of bht (tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6))s

Like blastn_db, but BLASTs against a list of databases.
Useful when you have one database per group and want to separate the hits.

For example:
  blastn_db_each 1e-20 my_species [bacteria, plants, fungi, metazoans]

Note that you should probably use a protein sequence search instead for
something like this.
