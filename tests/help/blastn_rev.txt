blastn_rev : num fna fna -> bht
where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

Like blastn, but with the FASTA files flipped.

Useful for the specific case where you want reciprocal best hits from separate
forward and reverse searches, and want to reduce the chances of messing up the
input order.

For example, these two are the same:

  fwd1 = blastn 1e-20 species1 species2
  rev1 = blastn 1e-20 species2 species1
  rbh1 = reciprocal_best fwd1 rev1

  fwd2 = blastn     1e-20 species1 species2
  rev2 = blastn_rev 1e-20 species1 species2
  rbh2 = reciprocal_best fwd1 rev2
