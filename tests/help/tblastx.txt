tblastx : num fna fna -> bht

where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

BLAST one file of nucleic acid (DNA) sequences against another,
comparing all possible protein translations.

WARNING: this is slow. It's equivalent to 6 * 6 = 36 blastp searches.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query   FASTA nucleic acid file
  a subject FASTA nucleic acid file

Algorithm:
  make a nucleotide database from the subject sequences
  BLAST translations of the query sequences against translations of the database

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
