[num (number in scientific notation), faa (FASTA (amino acid)),
 fna (FASTA (nucleic acid))] -> bht (tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6))

BLAST amino acid (protein) sequences against nucleic acid (DNA) sequences.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query   FASTA amino acid file
  a subject FASTA nucleic acid file

Algorithm:
  make a nucleotide database from the subject sequences
  BLAST the query proteins against translations (all 6 reading frames) of the database sequences

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
