blastn_rbh_each : num fna fna.list -> bht.list
where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

Like blastn_rbh, but the last argument is a list of files.
Useful when you want to find orthologs for one species in a list of others.
For example:

  hit_tables = blastn_rbh_each 1e-20 my_species [species1, species2, species3]
  shared_genes = all (extract_queries_each hit_tables)

Note that you might want to use a protein sequence search instead for this.
