[num (number in scientific notation), fna (FASTA (nucleic acid)),
 list of fna (FASTA (nucleic acid))s] -> list of bht (tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6))s

Like blastn_rbh, but the last argument is a list of files.
Useful when you want to find orthologs for one species in a list of others.
For example:

  hit_tables = blastn_rbh_each 1e-20 my_species [species1, species2, species3]
  shared_genes = all (extract_queries_each hit_tables)

Note that you might want to use a protein sequence search instead for this.
