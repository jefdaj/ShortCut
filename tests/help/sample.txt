Take a random sample from a list. Can be used to test your
algorithm on a smaller set of genes/genomes, or as the 'permute'
step in the permute, repeat, summarize (PRS) pattern.

Random (but reproducable) sampling of list elements.

WARNING: Because of the way OrthoLang caches tempfiles, calling these
more than once will give the same sublist each time! For different
sublists, use in combination with the 'repeat' function
