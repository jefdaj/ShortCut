num bst faa.list -> faa.list

Filter a list of transcriptomes or proteomes by their BUSCO completeness score.

Arguments:
  minimum completeness score
  busco scores table
  list of fastas to filter

The separate table facilitates scoring all the species you might want to
include at the beginning of a project, then quickly filtering them later. Think
of it like doing one low-stringency BLAST search and then separately filtering
the hits.

(Separate function coming soon to auto-generate the table from fastas only)

Example:

prots = load_faa_each ...
table = busco_proteins_each euk prots
prots95 = busco_filter_completeness 95 table prots
