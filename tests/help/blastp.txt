blastp : num faa faa -> bht
where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  faa = FASTA amino acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

BLAST one file of amino acid (protein) sequences against another.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query   FASTA amino acid file
  a subject FASTA amino acid file

Algorithm:
  make a protein database from the subject sequences
  BLAST the query sequences against the database

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
