num fna fna.list -> bht.list

Like blastn_rev, but BLASTs a list of sequence files against the first one.

The _rev_each functions are useful in situations where you would like to use an
_rbh_each, but can't because the forward and reverse searches need to be done
differently. They do the reverse half.

For example if my_species is faa and species1, 2, and 3 are fna:

  fwds = tblastn_each    1e-20 my_species [species1, species2, species3]
  revs = blastx_rev_each 1e-20 my_species [species1, species2, species3]
  rbhs = reciprocal_best_each fwds revs
