megablast : num fna fna -> bht

  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

Like blastn, but faster at finding very similar matches.

This is probably what you think of as blastn if you've been using the NCBI
site. See this blog post for details:
