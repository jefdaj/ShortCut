tblastn_db : num faa fna.blastdb -> bht

where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  faa = FASTA amino acid
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

Like tblastn, but BLASTs against an existing database.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query FASTA amino acid file
  a subject BLAST nucleotide database

Algorithm:
  BLAST the query sequences against the database

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
