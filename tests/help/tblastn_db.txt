[num (number in scientific notation), faa (FASTA (amino acid)),
 fna (FASTA (nucleic acid)) encoded as blastdb] -> bht (tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6))

Like tblastn, but BLASTs against an existing database.

Inputs:
  an e-value cutoff
  a query FASTA amino acid file
  a subject BLAST nucleotide database

Algorithm:
  BLAST the query sequences against the database

Output:
  a table of all hits below the cutoff
