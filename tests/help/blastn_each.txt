blastn_each : num fna fna.list -> bht.list
where
  num = number in regular or scientific notation
  fna = FASTA nucleic acid
  bht = tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6)

Like blastn, but BLASTs against a list of subject sequence files.

For example:
  blastn_each 1e-20 my_species [species1, species2, species3]
