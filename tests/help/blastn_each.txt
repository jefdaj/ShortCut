[num (number in scientific notation), fna (FASTA (nucleic acid)),
 list of fna (FASTA (nucleic acid))s] -> list of bht (tab-separated table of blast hits (outfmt 6))s

Like blastn, but BLASTs against a list of subject sequence files.

For example:
  blastn_each 1e-20 my_species [species1, species2, species3]
