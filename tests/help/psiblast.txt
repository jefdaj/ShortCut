Iterated PsiBLAST (BLAST+) searches using position-specific substitution matrixes.

There are a lot of these! Some naming conventions:

* A fn with `train` trains and returns one or more pssms ; one without
`train` runs a regular blast search and returns hits.

* A fn with `db` takes one or more blast databases directly; one without
`db` auto-builds the db(s) from one or more fastas.

* A fn with `all` takes a list of fastas and creates one db from it.

* A fn with `each` maps over its last argument. The difference between
`each` and `all` is that `each` returns a list of results, whereas `all`
summarizes them into one thing.

* A fn with `pssms` (plural) takes a list of pssm queries and combines
their hits into one big table.

So for example...


```
psiblast_train_all : num faa faa.list -> pssm
  auto-builds one blast db from a list of fasta files
  trains a pssm for the query fasta on it
  returns the pssm
```

```
psiblast_each : num faa faa.list -> bht.list
  auto-builds one db per subject fasta
  trains a pssm for the query fasta against each one
  runs a final psiblast search against each one using the pssm
  returns a list of hit tables
```
