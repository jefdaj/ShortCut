# A list of empty lists should have a nonzero length. (This was surprisingly
# tricky to get working because it conflicts with deduplicating lists by their
# content)

# TODO include a repl test for the types?
# TODO there's also a potentially serious bug: type "[[], [1]]", get [[], []]

zero = length_each []       # []
one  = length_each [[]]     # [0]
two  = length_each [[], []] # [0, 0]

result = [zero, one, two] # [[], [0], [0, 0]]
