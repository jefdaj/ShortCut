# Demo of the type system.
# Things to cover:
# each expression has a type that decides which functions it can go in
# compare that to python again (adding a num and str)
# helps ensure that your long-running code won't error out partway through
# types are used for file extensions
# :type of a few things
# append .list for list of whatever
