tests/list01
	doesn't create the output file
	not sure if this is an actual problem
	next steps:
		remove explicit empty list case altogether
		put in a sensible error instead

tests/repl03
	that one line keeps printing to actual stdout instead of being captured
	some kind of interaction between tasty and silently?
	next steps:
		try reproducing it without tasty (separate main file)
		email/file github issue with author
		ask on stackoverflow

division
	division by certain numbers hangs for a long time (forever?)
	seems to only happen with non-powers-of-two?
	next steps:
		try manually `read`ing + doing the math in ghci
