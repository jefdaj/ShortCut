bugs:
  loading a bad script should never crash the interpreter! just print the error
  ctrl-c during operation should cancel it but not crash the interpreter; 2nd one should
  parens removed when they do make a difference in math
  are repeats not evaluated in parallel? they should be
  extract_ids from a list doesn't give a type error
  even without updatable completions, should be able to re-init on :load/:reload
  when :writing a variable, still assign it and add a separate result var

examples:
  command line + repl usage (asciinema)
    tab completion
    history up/down/search
  basic syntax (function calls, parens, lists, comments, ...)
  function variants: _each, _all, concat_, etc.
  set operations, including all being used for concat_str
    include these in the venn diagrams example too
    show how lists get weird because of the hashing
  in include.cut, warn that the scripts will be merged when :writing

things to prefetch:
  all blast dbs with blastdbget
  a few common biomartr things?
  see download.cut

nice if time:
  load urls
  load should handle unzipping/untargzing
  number of arrows should correspond to running operations, not max threads
  sort lists the intuitive way?
