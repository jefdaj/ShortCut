sunday:
  diamond module

    read manual
      handles temporary files itself; output only appears at the end and is thrown away if inturrupted
      looks to be deterministic! same input -> same output according to the author
      things that can be set to speed it up/improve results:
        -e as low as possible
        -k as low as possible, or use --top instead
      later, optional taxonomy features?
      looks to be multithreaded by default
      any need to set the scoring matrix?
      can output the same regular blast results. winning!
        but there's an intermediate DAA (diamond alignment archive) format too. not sure if needed?
      can gzip the output

    test running diamond and getting blast output
    write scaffolding code

    write useful functions
      x diamond_makedb
      x diamond_makedb_all
      search variants: fasta + db, regular + sensitive + more sensitive, blastp + blastx
        diamond_blastp
        diamond_blastp_db
        diamond_blastp_sensitive
        diamond_blastp_db_sensitive
        diamond_blastp_more_sensitive
        diamond_blastp_db_more_sensitive
        diamond_blastx
        diamond_blastx_db
        diamond_blastx_sensitive
        diamond_blastx_db_sensitive
        diamond_blastx_more_sensitive
        diamond_blastx_db_more_sensitive
      something to load existing databases? maybe not important yet

    print data:
      x diamond dbinfo to print dbs
      diamond view to print results

    write tests

  mmseqs module
    scaffolding
  sonicparanoid module
    scaffolding
