# Demo of tmpfiles + links.
#   everything gets a tmpfile, even if you type it live
#   variables are symlinks (shortcuts!) to expression files (show debug info)
#   cached files are recreated when you delete them
#   can open them separately when needed
#   latest thing is always linked from "result"

string1 = "good morning!"
result = string1
