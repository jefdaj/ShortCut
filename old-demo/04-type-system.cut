# Demo of the type system:
#   expressions have types that decide which functions they can go in
#   compare that to adding a num and str in python
#   :type of vars, num, num.list etc
#   helps ensure that your long-running code won't error out partway through
#   types are used for file extensions
#   append .list for list of whatever

number1 = 4
