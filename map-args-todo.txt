this got a little wierd, but don't throw it all out! it might be almost right

the main new idea is that you could rewrite debugNeed to say,
"if i need an each/*.args file, need the each/.argsdone instead and then assume"

you already have the part about writing the .argsdone file, that works
you probably have some extra junk related to trying not to need them at all; throw that out in favor of need-rewriting

hmm, is it actually working in most cases? maybe only singletons have an issue
or even just blastp itself? that would be weird
oh, maybe just the *FromFa* ones. that seems reasonable
  if so, could be the makeblastdb_*_each failing
    oh that has singletons too

failing tests:
  ncbi_blast_blastp.cut
  ncbi_blast_blastp_db.cut
  ncbi_blast_blastx.cut
  ncbi_blast_blastx_db.cut

is everything with blastp_each or blastx_each failing?

oh so what do blastp and blastx have in common? they're the only ones that make a protein database

weirdly the tests with reverse ones too don't fail

oh but you also have to turn off retrying to get the obvious errors to manifest...
